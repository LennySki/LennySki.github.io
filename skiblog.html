    <p>I finished the CSS crash course today. Despite being the video being an hour and a half long, it took me a couple days to follow along with everything. I found it real interesting and am enjoying this process a ton so far. There were numerous points throughout the video as I was following along but something on my end did not match up with the video. I found it real fascinating having to go back and find where I mistakenly hit an extra exclamation point, forgot a bracket or some other detail that tends to muck things up. Next up on the comprehensive list is Java Script. I've got no idea what to expect but am looking forward to it. In the mean time, I'm also continuing with working on this site so that I can put my HTML and CSS learnings to actual practice. To sum it up a little better, I'm spending one time chunk daily going through a lesson or tutorial and then another block later in the day is used to put my learnings to practice.</p>

    <p>Hey-yo!!! I've got my blog going on a Github page which will most likely evolve into my portfolio site as well. The github setup was super simple. I used <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/how-to-host-a-website-for-free/">THIS GUIDE </a> to help me get things started. It took me an hour or two to figure out linking my CSS sheet to my page. The culprit? I had the "C" is css.style capitalized which let me to learn that the pages you point to in HTML are case sensitive. By the time you read this entry, I'll hopefully have a style sheet set up for the blog but I'll add a screenshot below of how rudimentary my formatting was in learning things so early on.</p>
