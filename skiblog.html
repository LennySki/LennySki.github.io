    Hey-yo!!! I've got my blog going on a Github page which will most likely evolve into my portfolio site as well. The github setup was super simple. I used <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/how-to-host-a-website-for-free/">THIS GUIDE </a> to help me get things started. It took me an hour or two to figure out linking my CSS sheet to my page. The culprit? I had the "C" is css.style capitalized which let me to learn that the pages you point to in HTML are case sensitive. By the time you read this entry, I'll hopefully have a style sheet set up for the blog but I'll add a screenshot below of how rudimentary my formatting was in learning things so early on.
