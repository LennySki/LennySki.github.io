    <p>Woo doggy... First off... almost forgot to write in here. Second, I'm going through the JavaScript eBook and it is a lot of "what?" I'm understanding some concepts but it's very hit and miss. I think this is where my practical timeblocks will come into play. With that said... I'll get to it! P.S. I think I'm supposed to add notes on GitHub each time I make an update so that starts today. P.S.S. The next two weeks will be a little hit and miss here. Tomorrow is veterans day and my kids' are out of school. Then... next week I'm out of town and then the following week is Thanksgiving. Will stay committed still but frequency will be spotty for now.</p>

    <p>Went further along on Java Script today. I think my biggest takeaway was learning variables. I was kind of stuck on this and not quite sure what it's purpose was but after consulting ChatGPT, they helped me make sense of assigning variables and why they'd come in handy. Since it's still early in my journey, I find myself sometimes reading things and it kinda making sense at the surface but it does glaze over some. I imagine as I do more, that will help. For practical application. I think I may search out some gameified coding sites (if they exist) to help build up some better HTML, CSS and Java chops. If I get anywhere with this, I'll report back. One other thing I'll do today is migrate my two original Wix blog entries from November 2nd and 3rd below.</p>

    <p>I finished the CSS crash course today. Despite being the video being an hour and a half long, it took me a couple days to follow along with everything. I found it real interesting and am enjoying this process a ton so far. There were numerous points throughout the video as I was following along but something on my end did not match up with the video. I found it real fascinating having to go back and find where I mistakenly hit an extra exclamation point, forgot a bracket or some other detail that tends to muck things up. Next up on the comprehensive list is Java Script. I've got no idea what to expect but am looking forward to it. In the mean time, I'm also continuing with working on this site so that I can put my HTML and CSS learnings to actual practice. To sum it up a little better, I'm spending one time chunk daily going through a lesson or tutorial and then another block later in the day is used to put my learnings to practice.</p>

    <p>Hey-yo!!! I've got my blog going on a Github page which will most likely evolve into my portfolio site as well. The github setup was super simple. I used <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/how-to-host-a-website-for-free/">THIS GUIDE </a> to help me get things started. It took me an hour or two to figure out linking my CSS sheet to my page. The culprit? I had the "C" is css.style capitalized which let me to learn that the pages you point to in HTML are case sensitive. By the time you read this entry, I'll hopefully have a style sheet set up for the blog but I'll add a screenshot below of how rudimentary my formatting was in learning things so early on.</p>

    <h1>November 3, 2023</h1>
    <p>I was originally starting with Codecademy but good ol' Reddit came through with an pretty solid "Definitive Guide To Becoming A FullStack Developer (2022)" which I felt was new enough to still be relative. 


<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/uo8v25/the_definitive_guide_to_becoming_a_fullstack/?share_id=fhJ38g6QrafSVQjOgAHOp&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_source=share&utm_term=22">Reddit Guide</a>


I'm already tempted to get my own URL and hosting to start drafting my own site to document this but maybe I hang tight on that for a few more days.


So far... I've completed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&t=1s">HTML crash course</a> 



It ended up being somewhat of a refresher. I can't quite remember where but I must've learned some HTML either in high school or dabbling in it the past few years. I felt fortunate enough to breeze through that between yesterday and today.


Going to see how much further I can get through the Reddit guide before going into the weekend.</p>
    <h1>November 2, 2023</h1>
    <p>Here I am starting from scratch. My name is Lenny and I've decided to go down the path of becoming a full stack web developer (is that even the correct terminology?). I am currently a real estate agent. It's a great career and I've enjoyed it/done well but I am concerned about it's long-term prospects due to technology and legislation/litigation. I've signed up for the Codecademy career path and will be working on things daily to sharpen my skills. I don't anticipate that my path will be the most efficient but my hope is that by documenting my path, I will help someone else down the road.
Wish me luck!</p>
